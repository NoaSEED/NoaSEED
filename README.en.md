# SEEDNodes - Institutional NodeOps

## Purpose

SEEDNodes operates blockchain node infrastructure to institutional standards. We build automated, auditable, and scalable processes to run validators across multiple networks, establishing best practices for the industry in LATAM.

## Implementation Phases

- Phase 1: Research and baseline standards
- Phase 2: INOH (handbook), security standards, audit procedures
- Phase 3: Network playbooks (Ethereum, Gnosis, Starknet, Aztec)
- Phase 4: Monitoring & reporting (KPIs, dashboards)
- Phase 5: Continuous improvement (quarterly reviews)

## NodeOps Automation

- Current: automated scripts (bootstrap, hardening, deploy, monitor, backup, incident)
- Advanced: automated vulnerability detection and hardening; encrypted daily backups; automated incident response with notifications
- Multi‑network orchestration: unified CI/CD, centralized security and monitoring
- Predictive monitoring: resource trends, early threat detection, preventive scaling

## Institutional Security

- Zero‑trust: VPN + MFA, no hardcoded secrets
- Auditability: every action recorded in `audit-logs`
- Security testing: attack simulations via playbooks

## Integrated Audits

Each process produces verifiable evidence:
- Infrastructure: timestamp, actor, host, commit hash, result
- Security: post‑hardening checklist
- Backups: SHA256 + restore test
- Monitoring: metrics and SLA validation

## Deliverable

Every operational action at SEEDNodes generates complete audit evidence. Deployments, updates, and backups require verifiable proof to be considered valid—ensuring transparency, traceability, and trust for delegators, foundations, and stakeholders.
